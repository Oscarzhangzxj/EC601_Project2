# EC601_Project2

# Introduction:

My project aims to make it easier for people to find information on public platforms like Twitter and to do sentiment analysis on the content of Twitter texts. Furthermore, this project may be used to investigate current trends on Twitter as well as public attitude on the subject.

# User Story:
In real time, any tweeter or follower can learn about the most popular content or the hottest topic. Fans follow their favorite singers' real-time updates, such as where the singer has recently performed, what they are wearing, the star's personal life, and factual analysis of a hot topic.
